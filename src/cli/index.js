 * The default function export from this module registers all the available commands.
 * Each command is contained in it's own module, for..er...modularity.
 *
 * The command modules take an object as the argument with these properties:
 *  root: the root command which is used to register top-level commands.
 *  factory:  the command factory service that provides factories for creating
 *      new commands and command categories.
 *  app: the executing CLI instance. This can be used to modify the command line and re-execute
 *   the new command line by calling `app.runCommand(cmdarray)`.
 *
 * @param {object} context  The context for configuring the command.
